# JS Adventure 

JS Adventure, is a simple games code in JavaScript


#### Game manipulation :

for launch a new party type this command :

```javascript
newGame();
```
The life and attack variables are fixed for the moment (I will add a future functionality allowing to energize this)
For the moment the only way to change them is to change them yourself in game.js,

> The code is currently in development, 
> the game may have missing features or bugs.
